# Development guide

Repository-wide contributor setup and policy live here; component-specific implementation and commands stay with their component documentation:

| Topic | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| End-user prerequisites, setup, install, and normal startup | [`README.md`](../README.md) |
| Repository-wide contributor setup, full-app launcher, and quality gate | This guide |
| User-facing features and workflows | [`docs/FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md) |
| Component structure and invariants | [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| API-specific commands, configuration, database modes, backup/restore | [`apps/api/README.md`](../apps/api/README.md) |
| Extension build, adapters, keyboard controls | [`apps/extension/README.md`](../apps/extension/README.md) |
| Dashboard development | [`apps/web/README.md`](../apps/web/README.md) |
| Private/local adapter overlay | [`docs/PRIVATE.md`](PRIVATE.md) |
| Captured data, retention, and permissions | [`PRIVACY.md`](../PRIVACY.md) |
| Threat model and reporting | [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) |
| Release history | [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) |
| Contribution and support workflow | [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) |

## Local development

After cloning or forking the repository, install the prerequisites listed in the root [README](../README.md#requirements), then prepare the whole workspace from the repository root:

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

Start the assembled application for contributor work with:

```bash
bash scripts/dev.sh
```

The development launcher performs the same built-dashboard preflight as the normal launcher, binds to `127.0.0.1:3456`, and enables Uvicorn's automatic reload. For a component-only workflow such as Vite hot reload or starting just the API, use the commands in the relevant component README.

## Quality gate

`bash scripts/check.sh` is the single local entry point and runs the CI-equivalent gates: private-overlay drift, formatting, linting, type checking, tests, builds, generated-API drift, Markdown formatting, and version consistency. Run it before calling a change done; a green run is what CI reproduces.

Git hooks run a subset earlier so failures surface sooner. Install them once:

```bash
uv run --directory apps/api pre-commit install
```

Formatters that rewrite files stop at the commit stage — a push-stage fixer would land its fix in the working tree, outside the commits being pushed. The push stage re-checks the same ground in report-only form.

Individual tasks (`pnpm exec vp run test`, `uv run --directory apps/api pytest`, and the per-component scripts in each README) exist for fast iteration, but they are not a substitute for the gate.

## Source and generated files

Generated source artifacts are tracked so that a clean checkout builds and type-checks without first booting the server, but they are never hand-edited. Each has one generator, and the gate fails on drift:

| Generated file | Generator | Source of truth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/shared/src/api/schema.ts` | `pnpm --filter @job-tracker/shared gen:api` | FastAPI route and model definitions |
| `packages/shared/src/funnel/funnel.contract.json` | API test suite | `apps/api/app/core/enums.py` |
| `packages/shared/src/text/text.golden.json` | API test suite | `apps/api/app/core/text.py` |

Build output (`apps/*/dist/`), including `apps/extension/dist/manifest.json`, tool caches, and the four gitignored private overlay directories are not tracked. `pnpm run build:ext` regenerates the manifest from `apps/extension/manifest.config.ts` and the root `VERSION`; the gate builds and version-checks it. Changing a tracked generated artifact's shape means changing its generator and committing the regenerated result in the same change.

## Comments and documentation

Treat comments and documentation as release artifacts:

- Explain intent, invariants, constraints, and non-obvious tradeoffs.
- Prefer clearer code and names over comments that restate the implementation.
- Remove historical narration, repeated facts, padding, and phrases that add no useful context.
- Use concise, plain language, especially in UI copy, without dropping necessary meaning. Layouts must still handle legitimate long text safely.
- Keep each fact in one authoritative place and link to it when needed.
- Keep examples, commands, behavior descriptions, and version information accurate in the same change that affects them.
- Preserve important context when shortening text. A comment should explain why the code exists or what must remain true, not translate the code into prose.

## Markdown formatting

Prettier owns Markdown formatting, pinned in `package.json` and configured in `.prettierrc.json`. It is deliberately configured **not** to hard-wrap prose: a paragraph is one line, and your editor supplies the visual wrapping. This keeps diffs to the sentences that actually changed instead of reflowing whole paragraphs, and removes hand-cleaning from review.

```bash
pnpm run format:md   # write
pnpm run check:md    # report only, as scripts/check.sh runs it
```

Hard breaks, lists, tables, links, and fenced code keep their structure — only prose wrapping is normalized. `.prettierignore` excludes build output, dependencies, and `docs/plans/`, which holds immutable execution plans rather than public documentation.

This policy covers Markdown only. Ruff formats Python and the workspace TypeScript formatter (`vp fmt`, oxfmt) formats TypeScript; neither defers to Prettier.

## Database migration compatibility

`apps/api/app/core/schema.sql` is the 1.0.0 baseline: every pre-release migration is folded into it, so `_COLUMN_MIGRATIONS` and `_DATA_MIGRATIONS` in `apps/api/app/core/db.py` both start empty. See [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#database-and-synchronization) for how migrations are applied.

After 1.0.0, migrations are **append-only**:

- Add new entries at the end. Never edit, reorder, or remove a released entry: it has already run on some user databases and not others, so changing it makes those two states diverge silently.
- Give every migration a stable, unique key. The key is the ledger row in `schema_migrations` and the only record that it ran.
- Keep column migrations additive. Dropping or retyping a column breaks an older client still reading the same synchronized database.
- Migrations run at server start against whatever database is configured, including a Turso primary. Assume real data and no operator supervision, and back up first ([procedure](../apps/api/README.md#backup--restore)).
- Cover a new migration with a test that starts from a database in the _old_ shape and asserts the repair, and one that proves re-running it is a no-op.

A change that cannot be expressed additively is a breaking change and needs a major version bump plus an explicit note in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Releases and versions

The repository root `VERSION` file is the one product version, in SemVer. It covers the extension, the dashboard, and the server together — they ship from the same commit and are not independently versioned.

Everything else derives from it: `apps/extension/manifest.config.ts` reads it into the built manifest, and `apps/api/app/core/version.py` reads it into the API's OpenAPI metadata. `apps/extension/package.json` deliberately declares no `version` at all, and `apps/api/pyproject.toml`'s version is packaging metadata uv requires — neither is a release authority, and nothing ships either number. `bash scripts/check-version.sh` (part of the gate) fails if the canonical value, the built manifest, the API metadata, or a `vX.Y.Z` tag disagree.

Decide the bump from user-visible effect, in any component:

| Bump | When |
| --- | --- |
| Patch (`x.y.Z`) | Fixes and internal work with no new capability |
| Minor (`x.Y.0`) | New capability: an adapter surface, a setting, a dashboard or API feature |
| Major (`X.0.0`) | A breaking change, including a non-additive database change |

Individual commits do not bump the version. Bump once while preparing a release, then tag that same whole-repository commit `vX.Y.Z` and move the `CHANGELOG.md` entry from `Unreleased` to the new version. The gate rejects a tag that disagrees with `VERSION`, and any tag that does not match `vX.Y.Z`.

## Platform support

Linux and macOS are supported. Windows is not: the setup and run scripts are Bash, and the locked `libsql`/`pyturso` dependency set has no straightforward native-Windows wheel path. WSL2 supplies the supported Linux userspace and those locked Linux wheels, so it may work, but it is currently untested and unsupported.

Supporting native Windows would require supported dependency artifacts or a database-driver decision, portable launcher commands and paths, and a Windows setup/runtime CI smoke test. Until those exist, do not add speculative compatibility edits that no test can hold in place.
