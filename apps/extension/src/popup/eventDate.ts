// ── Event-date logic for the popup's status "as of <date>" chip ──────────────
// Pure helpers, split out of the React tree so the day/ts choices are unit-testable.
// The date is never blank: it defaults to the suggested email day, else today, and
// "now" resets to today rather than clearing. What reaches the server still
// distinguishes today — no override, let it stamp exact now — from a back-dated day,
// an explicit noon-local ts since the picker offers no clock time. Only a status
// change carries this date; notes and comments record at server-stamped now.
import { localDay } from "@job-tracker/shared/time";

// Today as the picker's YYYY-MM-DD (its non-blank default and "now" reset value).
export function todayDay(): string {
  return localDay(new Date().toISOString());
}

// The chip's text: a short label for a YYYY-MM-DD ("Jul 12"). Parsed at noon-local, so
// the day never shifts under a negative-offset timezone the way a bare date parsed as
// UTC midnight would. Falls back to the raw string when the day doesn't parse.

}

// The `ts` to POST for an event dated on `eventDate`:
//   • the suggested email's day → its full ISO, keeping the mail's real clock time
//     even when that day is today.
//   • today → undefined: no override, the server stamps exact now().
//   • any other day → noon-local ISO on it, avoiding a UTC day-shift.
