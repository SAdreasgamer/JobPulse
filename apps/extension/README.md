# Job Tracker — browser extension

Captures job listings from the sites you browse and lets you triage them (status / star / hide) straight from the page, against your Job Tracker server. It injects an action bar onto job cards and detail views, auto-detects signals like _applied_ / _rejected_, and captures the listing into the tracker.

Each supported site is a small **adapter**. Built-in ones (LinkedIn, and LinkedIn job emails in Gmail) ship under `src/adapters/builtin/`; your own go in the gitignored `src/adapters/local/<board>/`, so private scrapers are never tracked by the public repo. [`docs/PRIVATE.md`](../../docs/PRIVATE.md) covers how that overlay is stored and installed.

---

## Requirements

- Complete the root [project requirements and setup](../../README.md#requirements).
- A Chromium browser (Chrome / Edge / Brave).
- A running Job Tracker server (default `http://localhost:3456`).

## Build & load

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build          # emits the loadable extension into dist/
```

Then in the browser: `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** → select the **`dist/`** folder. After any source change, run `pnpm build` again and hit the reload ↻ on the extension card.

> The loaded artifact is always `dist/`, never the raw source. The build (Vite + [`@crxjs/vite-plugin`](https://crxjs.dev)) bundles the content script, service worker, and popup, and generates the MV3 `manifest.json`.

### Versioning

The manifest's version is not set here. `manifest.config.ts` reads the repository root `VERSION` file, the one product version shared with the dashboard and the server, so the extension is never bumped on its own — a user-visible change anywhere in the product decides the next number. The rules are in the [development guide](../../docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#releases-and-versions); the notes are in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md).

Run `pnpm build` and `pnpm typecheck` before calling a change done.

## Configure the server address

The API/dashboard origin lives in **one** place. Copy the example env and edit it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then set VITE_SERVER_URL, e.g. https://tracker.example.com
pnpm build
```

`VITE_SERVER_URL` feeds both the in-page fetches ([config.ts](src/config.ts)) and the manifest's `host_permissions` ([manifest.config.ts](manifest.config.ts)), defaulting to `http://localhost:3456`. The extension never stores or sends the server's optional `X-API-Key`, so keep `API_KEY` unset for a direct local connection or put a trusted intermediary in front to inject the header — otherwise every API call gets a `401`.

## Keyboard

Open the popup from any tab with **Alt+J** (rebind or clear it at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`). Inside the popup the flow is keyboard-first — type to search, then:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` / `↓` | move the highlight through results |
| `Enter` | open the highlighted result (or the first one) |
| `Backspace` | outside a text field, back out one level: add form → detail → results → clear search |
| `Esc` | close the browser popup |
| `1`–`9` | on a job, pick the Nth status move |
| `n` | on a job, start a note |
| `a` | open the fast-add form |
| `Ctrl`/`⌘ + Enter` | submit the open form (status / note / add) |

Single-letter and digit keys are ignored while a text field is focused, so they never swallow what you're typing.

## Search seeding & diagnostics

When the popup opens off-platform it tries to pre-fill the search box with the company, tagging each guess with the **rule** that produced it:

- `domain-label` — the domain label on a career site / company page
- `ats-path` — the company segment in a known ATS URL (Greenhouse, Lever, …)
- `gmail-subject` — parsed from the open email's subject (the tab title) on Gmail
- `typed` — you edited/typed the query yourself
- `none` — nothing worth seeding (box left empty)

Search diagnostics use one scope under **Settings → Search diagnostics**: **Never**, **30 minutes**, or **Always**. A fresh install is Never and sends no search-log request. Both active scopes store the full debugging context: page host, automatic seed and extraction rule, the seed's result count, final query and result count, and clicked job ID. Seed replacement is derived by comparing seed to final query, and a click from the presence of a job ID. The server keeps the newest 1,000 rows; **Clear stored data** erases them. See [`PRIVACY.md`](../../PRIVACY.md) for the complete data flow.

## Write your own adapter

An adapter is one object implementing the [`Adapter`](src/adapters/types.ts) contract. Only `matches` and `findCards` are required; everything else is optional and called only when present.

```ts
// src/adapters/local/myboard/adapter.ts
import type { Adapter } from "../../types";
// Capture-capable adapters import shared engine helpers from ../../../engine.js.
// DOM-only adapters (just findCards) need no imports.
import {
  injectDetailButtons,
  autoEmit,
  refreshStates,
  renderJob,
} from "../../../engine.js";

export const myBoardAdapter: Adapter = {
  matches: (host) => host === "jobs.myboard.com",

  // Map your prefixed render key back to the API's (platform, bare id).
  naturalKey: (id) =>
    id.startsWith("MB-")
      ? { platform: "myboard", platform_id: id.slice(3) }
      : null,

  // Tag each NEW list card: set dataset.jhId (a prefixed render key) plus
  // jobUrl / jobTitle / jobCompany, and return the tagged cards.
  findCards(doc) {
    const cards: HTMLElement[] = [];
    doc.querySelectorAll(".vacancy:not([data-jh-id])").forEach((el) => {
      const card = el as HTMLElement;
      const a = card.querySelector(
        'a[href*="/job/"]',
      ) as HTMLAnchorElement | null;
      if (!a) return;
      const m = a.href.match(/\/job\/(\d+)/);
      if (!m) return;
      card.dataset.jhId = "MB-" + m[1];
      card.dataset.jobUrl = a.href;
      card.dataset.jobTitle =
        card.querySelector("h3")?.textContent?.trim() || "";
      card.dataset.jobCompany = "My Board";
      cards.push(card);
    });
    return cards;
  },
};
```

Then register the host so the content script is injected there. Add the match glob to a `hosts.json` next to your adapter:

`src/adapters/local/hosts.json`:

```json
["https://jobs.myboard.com/*"]
```

Rebuild (`pnpm build`) and reload. That's the whole loop: **drop a file + a host line + rebuild.** No edits to the shared engine.

- `platform` is a free-form string on the server — a new adapter needs **zero server changes**.
- The engine asks every registered adapter's `naturalKey` in turn, so your prefix is owned entirely by your adapter.
- See the exported helpers in [engine.ts](src/engine.ts) for what a capture-capable adapter can call (`captureListingOnce`, `injectDetailButtons`, `autoEmit`, the banner/detail helpers, `toNaturalKey`, `detailText`, …).

### Built-in vs. local adapters

|  | Location | Tracked in the public repo? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Built-in (LinkedIn, Gmail) | `src/adapters/builtin/**` + `src/adapters/builtin/hosts.json` | yes — shipped |
| Local (yours) | `src/adapters/local/<board>/adapter.ts` + `src/adapters/local/hosts.json` | no — gitignored |

The engine doesn't care either way: `import.meta.glob` picks up whatever local adapters exist, or none on a clone where the folder is absent.
