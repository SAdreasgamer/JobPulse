"""Integration tests against a real (throwaway) Turso DB.

Excluded from the default offline run — opt in with `pytest -m turso`, which also
needs TURSO_TEST_DATABASE_URL / TURSO_TEST_AUTH_TOKEN in the environment (see
.env.example). Use this file for behaviours in-memory sqlite can't reproduce:
pyturso push()/pull() sync, embedded-replica write-through, libSQL driver quirks.
Everything else belongs in the fast in-memory suite.
