"""Report events whose timestamps contradict the job lifecycle, read-only.

Bulk capture can stamp `created` or `applied` at scan time rather than when the
event happened, making a job appear rejected before it was created. This command
finds those contradictions and classifies the evidence available for repair.
The `--snapshot` and `--compare` modes verify that corrections remove violations
without changing projected statuses.

Never writes to the tracker. Corrections go through `PATCH /api/events/{id}`.

Usage (from apps/api/, so the app package is importable — matches
`scripts/dump_openapi.py`):
  uv run python -m scripts.scan_event_order                    # report
  uv run python -m scripts.scan_event_order --snapshot pre.json
  uv run python -m scripts.scan_event_order --compare pre.json # after applying
