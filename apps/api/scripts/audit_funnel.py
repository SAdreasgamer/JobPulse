"""Report event logs the API could not have produced, read-only.

`core/enums.py::target_status` is the one guard every submitted transition
passes: it refuses to reclassify a terminal outcome, to step backward in the
active funnel, or to ghost a job that was never applied to. So a log that
*violates* it was never written as one submission: either a bulk import INSERTed
rows directly, or a merge concatenated two jobs' logs. That is how a job rejected
on 2025-07-30 ended up `closed` — the same import later appended a "no recorded
outcome" `closed` whose newer timestamp won the projection and masked the
rejection.

A finding is not automatically wrong: a merge legitimately fuses two histories
that disagree (a job you `skipped`, whose repost the scraper later saw `closed`),
and only you can say which outcome is the honest one. It IS always a place where
the projection is asserting one thing while the log records another.

This replays each log in projection order and asks the real guard whether it
would have accepted each organic event. `corrected:<status>` rows are the
sanctioned override, so they are applied without complaint — an override that
was recorded as one is exactly what we want to see.

Never writes to the tracker. Repairs go through `POST /api/jobs/{id}/corrections`
(a deliberate reclassification) or `POST /api/jobs/{id}/status/revert` (dropping
a fabricated event outright).

Usage (from apps/api/, so the app package is importable — matches
`scripts/scan_event_order.py`):
  uv run python -m scripts.audit_funnel
  uv run python -m scripts.audit_funnel --source gmail-import  # blame one import
