"""Recompute the stored `company_key` / `title_key` after a normalizer change.

Both keys are derived at write time, so a change to `app.core.text` only reaches
rows saved afterwards — existing jobs keep the keys their old normalizer produced
and go on missing each other. This re-derives them in place from the `company` and
`title` already on the row; no name is rewritten, only its lookup key. `updated_at`
is deliberately left alone — repairing a derived key is not activity on the job, and
touching it would reshuffle the dashboard's newest-updated-first order wholesale.

`blocked_companies` is keyed BY `company_key` (it is half the primary key), so its
rows are rewritten too, from the human `label` the block was created with. A rewrite
that would collide with an existing block is dropped instead: the two names now
normalize to one company, and one row already blocks it.

Usage (from apps/api/, so the app package is importable — matches
`scripts/merge_duplicates.py`):
  uv run python -m scripts.backfill_company_keys            # dry run, prints changes
  uv run python -m scripts.backfill_company_keys --execute  # apply
