"""Database connection lifecycle and a thin, driver-agnostic query layer.

The app runs on the `libsql` client, tests on stdlib `sqlite3`. Both speak the
same SQL and expose the same cursor API, but neither offers a row factory that
survives across drivers, so `query_all`/`query_one` build plain dicts from
`cursor.description`. Repositories depend only on these helpers and the `Conn`
protocol, never on a concrete driver.
